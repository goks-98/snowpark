# Introduction to Stored Procedures using Snowpark and SnowSIght UI

This repo contains all the sample code used to demonstrate snowpark capabilites as well as stored procedure scripts. You can clone this repository and start using it for local development to practice but remember to use your own .env file to store your secrets to connect to your accounts.  

## Note
All python scripts were developed using python version 3.8. While cloning the repo, make sure to create your python environemnt using python 3.8 or you may face some issues.
SnowPark currently supports python only until version 3.8, hence the note.
